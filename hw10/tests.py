##make sure to import the modules we need in this file
##refer back to the lesson8 code for how to write unittests
##we want one unittest class for each function in debug.py
##make sure to write extensive test cases for each function inside the class
##also make sure each individual test's name starts with the word 'test'
##i.e we want a test to check the length of a function name it test_length


























##don't have to do anything with this line
## it just ensures that your tests will run when you run this file
